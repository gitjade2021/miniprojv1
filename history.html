            Before Spanish colonization, the region now known as Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra, and La Union was famous for gold and visited by Japanese and Chinese traders. Local Austronesians called it “samtoy,” meaning “this is our language.”

            In 1572, Spanish explorer Juan de Salcedo named the area “Ylocos” and its people “Ylocanos” after discovering their peaceful coastal villages. Spanish rule brought churches and bell towers but also resistance due to abusive practices. Notable uprisings included the Dingras uprising (1589), Diego Silang’s revolt (1762), and the Basi Revolt (1807). Gregorio Aglipay, excommunicated in 1898, founded the Iglesia Filipina Independiente.

            Population growth and unrest led to the division of the Ilocos province into Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur on February 2, 1818. Laoag City, established as a city in 1965, became the capital of Ilocos Norte.
